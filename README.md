4=10 is a game where the objective is to use four given numbers and combine them in an expression that equals 10. You are allowed to use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and one set of parantheses.
For example, one of the possible solutions is (7*9-3)/6 if the given numbers are 9 3 7 6.
For some levels, some of the operations are disallowed.
